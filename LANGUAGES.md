# List of Accepted Languages

Submissions for the languages spoken in Southeast Asia (detailed in [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FX5oNdP2RcPseatKtXIKHfoppi_c986ZrV_gEX-ccgA/edit?usp=sharing)) would be very much appreciated.

### Are non-indigenous but major languages in SEA also accepted?

Yes! We also accept non-indigenous languages spoken in SEA regions, e.g., English, Portuguese, Mandarin Chinese, Tamil, Cantonese, etc.
Since this initiative is mainly to represent SEA, please make sure that those datasets are either collected: 1) from speakers in SEA or 2) in SEA regions.

## What about creoles?

Any creoles that are based on SEA official and/or indigenous languages (e.g., Singlish is based on English) are welcome!
