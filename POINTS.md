# Contribution point guideline

To be considered as co-author, 10 contribution points is required.

> **Note**: The purpose of the point system is not to barrier collaboration, but to reward rare and high-quality dataset entries.
We might adjust the point requirement lower to accomodate more co-authorship, if needed.

## Implementing Data Loader

Implementing any data loader is granted +3 pts, unless otherwise specified on the Github issue.
More details [here](DATALOADER.md).

## NusaCatalogue's Datasheet Proposal

### Datasheet Proposal as the Dataset's Author(s)
Proposing a datasheet of your own dataset is granted +4 pts.

As a support for data openness, for any data that is previously private, if Author(s) agree to make the dataset publicly available then additional +2 pts will be granted.

As a support for the development of local languages datasets:
- For dataset in Sundanese, Javanese, or Minangkabau, +2 pts will be granted
- For dataset in other local language, +4 pts will be granted

We understand that the quality of a dataset varies a lot. To support fairness in scoring datasets with different quality, for any dataset that does not achieve a certain minimum standard, 50% contribution score of the dataset will be penalized. This policy affects dataset that is collected with:
- Crawling without any manual validation process
- Machine / heuristic-rule labelled dataset, without any manual validation
- Machine translated dataset without any manual validation.

> **Note**: if there is more than 1 Author for a dataset, main Author will be eligible for nominating 1 more Author to be granted the same contribution score.

### Datasheet Proposal not as the Dataset's Author(s)
Proposing a datasheet of other people dataset is granted +1 pt.

## Listing Private Dataset
Each private dataset listed is granted +1 pt.
